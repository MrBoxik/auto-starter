# 🚀 auto starter

This is a small utility I coded that can launch any file, folder, or application automatically when Windows starts.
I made it to simplify managing my own startup items, but it can help anyone streamline their workflow.

## 🧩 Features

- ⚡ Launch anything like file, folder, .lnk or application ... at Windows start-up
- 🔁 Multiple items supported, with ordering (Move Up / Move Down)
- ▶️ “Run now” to test launching immediately
- 💾 Config is saved atomically to items.json in app data directory
- 🧲 Drag & drop support
- 🔒 Safety: app will not allow adding itself to the list (avoids loops)

## 🛡️ Important

Windows Defender or other antivirus software may flag this program as malicious because it automatically runs what you want on your computer.
- You can whitelist it if you trust it.
- Or simply delete it if you prefer.

It’s fully open source, so you can go through the code and verify for yourself that it only does what you want.
