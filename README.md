# 🚀 auto starter

This is a small utility I coded that can launch any file, folder, or application automatically when Windows starts.
I made it to simplify managing my own startup items, but it can help anyone streamline their workflow.

## 🛡️ Important

Windows Defender or other antivirus software may flag this program as malicious because it automatically runs what you want on your computer.
- You can whitelist it if you trust it.
- Or simply delete it if you prefer.

It’s fully open source, so you can go through the code and verify for yourself that it only does what you want.
